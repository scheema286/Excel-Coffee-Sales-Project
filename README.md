# Coffee Sales Dashboard Project

## Overview
This project is an Excel-based Coffee Sales Dashboard, developed to analyze and visualize sales data across different countries, coffee types, and time periods. The dashboard leverages advanced Excel functions and tools to provide insights into sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance.

- **Multiple IF Functions**: Applied logical tests to categorize and analyze data based on multiple conditions.
- **Date & Number Formatting**: Ensured consistent and readable presentation of date and numerical data.
- **Duplicate Check**: Identified and resolved duplicate entries to maintain data integrity.
- **Convert Range to Table**: Organized data into structured tables, enabling easier analysis and manipulation.
- **Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts**: Created dynamic tables and charts to summarize and visualize data from various perspectives.
- **Timeline & Slicers**: Added interactive timelines and slicers for enhanced data filtering and analysis.
- **Updating Data Source**: Ensured that pivot tables and charts reflect the latest data by dynamically updating the data source.
- **Dashboard Creation**: Built a comprehensive and interactive dashboard that provides a clear overview of key metrics.
